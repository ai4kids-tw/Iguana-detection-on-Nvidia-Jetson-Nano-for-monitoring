# Iguana-detection-on-Nvidia-Jetson-Nano-for-monitoring
This page is the Github repo of the open source project "Iguana detection and monitoring" in the Nvidia Jetson community. Using Jetson Nano with Nvidia Deepstream, we can detect iguana and streaming data in real time. A web-based UI is built to monitor the streaming data.
